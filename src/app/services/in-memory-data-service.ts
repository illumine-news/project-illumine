                <div>First, the author starts with a "Guess Who Said It!" game that challenges readers to distinguish Bernie Sanders quotes from Donald Trump ones. Although the intent of the exercise seems pretty clearly aimed at showing how low Sanders was willing to go to win; it seems rather unlikely that any of these statements did serious damage to the Sanders campaign in 2016. What's more, the author does not even follow-up with the statements, instead transitioning to (for the rest of the article) discuss Beto Rourke as the rightful (?) candidate to be protected from Sanders supporters as we approach 2020.</div>
                <div>And it is with the aim of protecting the author's apparent chosen golden boy in O'Rourke that the rest of the article devolves into suggesting possible ways of controlling a large electronic mob of Bernie supporters.</div>
